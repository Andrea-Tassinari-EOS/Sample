# What is "RoleCenter Record Link" 
The purpose of the sample is to provide a way to add the record link in the RoleCenter.

Drawbacks:
- RoleCenter page must be manually refreshed to see new records.
- Business Central must be opened to see the notifications.

The main solution for notifications is to use email.
