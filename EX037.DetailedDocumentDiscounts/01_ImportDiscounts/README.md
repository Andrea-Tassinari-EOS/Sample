## Importing discounts to Detailed Line Discounts app 
This extension allows you to import detailed discounts to Sales Lines and Purchase Lines.

 The app extends these tables

- "Purchase Lines"
- "Sales Lines"

adding the field "**EOS Import Dtld. Discount**".

When EOS Import Dtld. Discount is validated, the Detailed Document Discounts tables are populated as well, according to this app business logic.

This can be done calling the Validate method by code or by uploading a configuration package with RapidStart.
